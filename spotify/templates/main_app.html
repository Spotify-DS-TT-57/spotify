            Using your top 10 recent tracks, our model suggests a playlist of 10 tracks you should dislike. 
            It also queries the lyrics of the suggested tracks and comes up with a suggested playlist name. Think you can guess which song is responsible for the name on your screen? Might have to listen to a couple tracks to help.
            If the bad playlists get too much to bear, click the "Generate good suggestions" button right below the player to get some relief with a playlist suggestion you'd like.
            Listen below right in our app and click the Spotify icon for a particular track to be routed to its Spotify page.
            Please be aware the more further out of the norm your bad suggestions are, the longer it could take to generate. Please be a bit patient.
            Check out the About page for more info but most of all, have fun!
